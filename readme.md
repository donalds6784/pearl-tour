    ## üß± BEM convention (quick guide)

    BEM = Block, Element, Modifier. It helps keep class names predictable and components reusable.

    | Part     | Description                        | Example                                 |
    | -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
    | Block    | Standalone component               | `.card`, `.nav`, `.hero`                |
    | Element  | Child part of a block              | `.card__title`, `.nav__item`            |
    | Modifier | Variation/state of a block/element | `.card--featured`, `.nav__item--active` |

    ### Syntax examples

    ```css
    .block {
    	/* base block */
    }
    .block__element {
    	/* child element */
    }
    .block--modifier {
    	/* variation */
    }
    .block__element--modifier {
    	/* element variation */
    }
    ```

    ## ‚úÖ Code standards & requirements

    Follow these to keep contributions consistent and review-friendly:

    1. Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, article, footer).
    2. Follow BEM naming for CSS classes.
    3. Keep CSS modular ‚Äî separate concerns by component when practical.
    4. Use CSS variables in `:root` for colors, spacing, and type scale.

    Example CSS variables:

    ```css
    :root {
    	--primary-color: #1e90ff;
    	--font-size-base: 1rem;
    }
    ```
