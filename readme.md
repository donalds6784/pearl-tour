## üß± BEM convention (quick guide)

BEM = Block, Element, Modifier. It helps keep class names predictable and components reusable.

| Part     | Description                        | Example                                 |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Block    | Standalone component               | `.card`, `.nav`, `.hero`                |
| Element  | Child part of a block              | `.card__title`, `.nav__item`            |
| Modifier | Variation/state of a block/element | `.card--featured`, `.nav__item--active` |

### Syntax examples

```css
.block {
	/* base block */
}
.block__element {
	/* child element */
}
.block--modifier {
	/* variation */
}
.block__element--modifier {
	/* element variation */
}
```

### HTML + CSS example

```html
<div class="card card--featured">
	<h2 class="card__title card__title--large">Welcome</h2>
	<p class="card__description">This is a featured card.</p>
	<a href="#" class="card__button card__button--secondary">Learn More</a>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
	border: 1px solid #ccc;
	padding: 1rem;
}
.card--featured {
	border-color: gold;
}
.card__title {
	font-size: 1.2rem;
}
.card__title--large {
	font-size: 2rem;
}
.card__button--secondary {
	background-color: #7f8c8d;
}
```

## ‚úÖ Code standards & requirements

Follow these to keep contributions consistent and review-friendly:

1. Use semantic HTML (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`).
2. Follow BEM naming for CSS classes.
3. Keep CSS modular ‚Äî separate concerns by component when practical.
4. Use CSS variables in `:root` for colors, spacing, and typography scale.

Example CSS variables:

```css
:root {
	--primary-color: #1e90ff;
	--font-size-base: 1rem;
}
```
